## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. User opens the camera and captures a photo of a student's MCQ answer sheet.
2. ML Kit OCR reads the answers (e.g., `"1 A", "2 B"`).
3. The extracted answers are saved to a Room database.
4. The app compares these answers against a predefined answer key.
5. A score is computed and stored.
6. The result is displayed in a structured, scrollable list of students.
